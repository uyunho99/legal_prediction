      "carol anne bond was found guilty of trying to poison her husband's mistress, myrlinda haynes, with toxic chemicals at least 24 times over the course of several months. a grand jury in the eastern district of pennsylvania charged bond with two counts of possessing and using a chemical weapon, in violation of a criminal statute implementing the treaty obligations of the united states under the 1993 chemical weapons convention. the grand jury also charged bond with two counts of mail theft. bond's attorneys argue that the statute was intended to deal with rogue states and terrorists and that their client should have been prosecuted under state law instead. bond, a laboratory technician, stole the chemical potassium dichromate from the company where she worked. haynes was not injured. bond's husband had a child with haynes while married to bond. haynes had contacted police and postal authorities after finding the chemicals at her home. in september 2009, the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit held that bond lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the basis of the tenth amendment.\n",

      "on march 12, 2003, steven levin was scheduled to undergo cataract surgery performed by lieutenant commander frank bishop, m.d., a secondparty navy surgeon in guam. levin previously gave his written consent to the procedure but claims that he attempted to orally withdraw it prior to the surgery. he suffered complications from the surgery and faces continuing treatment with unclear likelihood of success. levin sued dr. bishop for battery and negligent medical malpractice. the secondparty substituted itself for dr. bishop and filed a motion for summary judgment. the district court granted summary judgment for the negligent medical malpractice claim, not the battery claim. the secondparty then filed for dismissal of the battery claim and alleged that the federal tort claims act preserved sovereign immunity against battery claims. the district court dismissed the claim. the secondparty court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.\n",
